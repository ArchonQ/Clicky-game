# Clicky-game
Clicky-Game is a memory game where the user must select a character that has not been selected yet each turn. With every correct selection, the user's score increments by one. Once the user selects a character that they have already clicked on, the score resets. With every selection made, the characters' locations shuffle, making for a fun and challenging experience
